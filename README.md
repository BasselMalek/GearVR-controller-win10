# GearVR-controller-win10
A project to utilize the GearVR contoller as an input device for win10, the current implementation is a very jank implementation based on the Bleak Python library.  
TO-DO:
- [ ] Improve current implementation
- [X] Write a more efficent implementation (C++)
- [ ] ~Write a low level implementation to improve to further improve performance and compatibility (C)~
  
  
  
  
  
  
*It goes without saying that without the work of @jsyang and the extensive documentaion on his reverse enginnering process none of this would be possible.*
