# GearVR-controller-win10

My personal take on interfacing with the Samsung GearVR Contoller on PC.

## Features

- [x] CLI interface.
- [x] Remappable buttons.
- [x] Touchpad tracking.
- [x] Touchpad D-pad.
- [x] 3d cursor (experimental, needs further calibration to fix drift/jitter).

## Credits

- @jsyang for their extensive documentation on their reverse engineering process.
- @xioTechnologies for their implementation of the Magdwick fusion algorithm.
- @metayeti for their handy .ini library.
