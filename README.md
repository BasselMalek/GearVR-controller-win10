# GearVR-controller-win10
My personal take on interfacing with the Samsung GearVR Contoller on PC.
## Why this exits?
Being my first experience with C++ outside of competitive programming, I wanted to learn new concepts and make use of the GearVR headset that I barely use. 
The main three concepts I learned here were: C++/WinRT, BluetoothLE Stack, and working in Visual Studio (which I dreaded the most).
## TO-DO:
- [X] Write a more efficient implementation (C++)
- [ ] Implement Accelerometer, Gyroscope, and Magnetometer data parsing
- [ ] Implement an IMU algorithm
- [ ] Switch to an asynchronous workflow

## Credits
It goes without saying that without the work of @jsyang and the extensive documentation on his reverse engineering process none of this would be possible.
